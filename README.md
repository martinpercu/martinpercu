# Hey, I'm Martin 👋

Full-Stack Developer based in **NYC** with 4 years building production web apps. I specialize in **Angular**, **TypeScript**, and **Node.js**, and recently dove deep into **AI engineering** — LangChain, RAG, vector databases, and agentic workflows.

Before tech, I founded two startups. That taught me to ship fast, own problems end-to-end, and think about code as a tool for business impact.
